Installation {#install}
======================

`ssmpack` is a header-only library. It can be installed without build:

    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make install

But in order to include `ssmpack` following packages should also be installed:
1. `armadillo >= 7`
2. `sequences` [link](https://github.com/taocpp/sequences)
